Accept arguments: `\u003csession-id\u003e` and `\u003cref\u003e`\n2. Verify `\u003cref\u003e` is an ancestor of `@` (working copy)\n   - Use `jj log -r '\u003cref\u003e::@'` or similar to check ancestry\n   - Error if not ancestor: \"Error: \u003cref\u003e is not an ancestor of the working copy\"\n3. Update the target revision's description with session ID trailer\n   - Use `jj describe \u003cref\u003e` to add/update the session trailer\n   - Format: `Session-Id: \u003csession-id\u003e` (following commit trailer conventions)\n4. Update jjagent's internal state to track this revision as the session commit\n\n## Slash Command (`commands/into.md`)\n- Model: claude-haiku-4-5 (like split.md)\n- Allowed tools: `Bash(jjagent into:*)`\n- Arguments: Accept `\u003cref\u003e` as $1\n- Instructions:\n  1. Extract session ID from system reminder\n  2. Run: `jjagent into \u003csession-id\u003e \u003cref\u003e`\n  3. Inform user that session tracking moved to specified revision\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- Create: `commands/into.md` (slash command definition)\n- Modify: `src/main.rs` or relevant module to add `into` subcommand\n- Possibly modify: session tracking logic to support this operation\n\n## Validation\n- Must verify ancestry to prevent invalid state\n- Should preserve existing commit content, only update metadata (description trailer)","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-21T21:24:53.076235-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T21:31:27.240862-07:00"}
{"id":"jjagent-2","title":"Verify jj split working copy behavior matches jjagent expectations","description":"When using `jj split`, the working copy moves to the second (child) part of the split. We need to verify that jjagent's split implementation handles this correctly and keeps the working copy where we want it.\n\nAccording to `jj split` man page: \"your edited content will replace the previous revision. The remaining changes will be put in a new revision on top.\"\n\nCurrent jjagent implementation at src/jj.rs:943 uses `jj new --insert-before @ --no-edit` which should keep the working copy at @, but we need to confirm:\n1. This is the desired behavior (working copy stays on top)\n2. Test that our assumption is correct\n3.
